# Abstract
The conventional method of manually inputting timetable information can be time-consuming and error-prone. To address this issue, we propose a novel solution for our in-house college app ‘Mpstme OnTrack’ that leverages computer vision and optical character recognition (OCR) technologies. Our model aims to automate the process of timetable extraction from images, making the scheduling and organization of academic activities more streamlined and accurate.
This model achieves a Character Accuracy of 94.36% and Layout Accuracy of 81.83%. Accuracy can be further increased by training our model on such similar documents.
